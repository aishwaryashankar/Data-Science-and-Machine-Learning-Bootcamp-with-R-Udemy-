logistic regression is a method for "classification"
classification = problem of identifying which category something belongs to (ie. spam vs ham emails, disease diagnosis, etc...)
binary classification: 0 or 1
logistic regression curve only goes between 0 and 1
Sigmoid = logistic function - takes in any value and outputs it to be between 0 and 1
You can use a confusion matrix to evaluate classification models
Confusion Matrix - table used to describe performance of classification model on set of test data for which the true values are already known

Terminology to know:
- True Positive (TP) - predicted yes and actual yes
- True Negative (TN) - predicted no and actual no
- False Positive (FP) - predicted yes but actual no
- False Negative (FN) - predicted no but actual yes
Accuracy (overall, how often is it correct): (TP + TN)/total
Misclassification Rate (overall, how often is it wrong):
(FP + FN)/total
